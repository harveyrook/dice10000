# dice10000

Dice 10000 simulator

Simulates different players playing dice 10000, each with different strategies.

What I've learnt....

1. Drop fives if it lets you role 3 or more dice.
2. Stand if you have 350 or more points and 3 dice. 
3. The difference between standing at 350 or 400, or 450 is minimal. 
4. The game is very random. You will end with less than 8000 points 40% of the time. You will be close to winning 5% of the time.
